## Problem Statement

Marven Market faces challenges in effectively managing its operations due to limited insights into sales trends, inventory management issues, insufficient 
understanding of customer behavior, lack of financial performance visibility, and difficulties in monitoring key operational metrics. These challenges hinder 
the company's ability to optimize its business processes and make data-driven decisions, necessitating a comprehensive PowerBI report to provide actionable insights 
and support strategic planning.
